# BarkBark
Project for class Software Engineering EECS-3093C course

## Objective
Bark Bark is a web application intended to be a local event finder where
you can see what events people are barking at and bark at local events
yourself. This social media app helps locate events, restaurants and other
entertainment while providing additional information with embedded links
(Eg. Yelp, Google Maps, Facebook).

This location-based app will identify nearby points of interest by walking
a user’s virtual dog and allowing users to prompt their dog to bark at interesting
events. You can anonymously bark at any events integrated with the app (Eg.
Yelp, Google Maps, Facebook) and custom events such as parties or gatherings
for other users to see. Users will receive notifications of barks in categories
they are interested in, and the location they are in at the time. 

* The purpose is to be an event finder and rating application for local events,
restaurants and other entertainment venues
* An app where users have a virtual dog
* Imagine you are walking your dog, your dog barks at something interesting and
you share what your dog barks at
* A bark is a ping to tell others of events and locations you are interested in
* Users can have their pet dog bark at (pin) anything within a nearby radius
* Simplified rating system to find local events happening currently
* Social app where you and others can share and bark at local upcoming and
ongoing events
* Maintain history of a person’s barks 
* Create an individual dog avatar and use custom dog emojis 

It serves as a great way to learn ratings about nearby places like restaurants
or movie theaters and the services they provide like be able to rate the
specific dishes within the restaurant. It becomes tedious and exhausting to sort
through reviews and pictures to learn about specific locations or events thus
this is an easier ratings system as there are no words or pictures but just simple
emojis that describe the emotion.
